# Anime_viewer_characteristics
In this report, I will explore the relationship between use of official anime viewing platforms and the characteristics of an anime viewer. The 2020 Anime Survey (Reysen et al., 2020) will be analyized for the probability of a anime viewer using official anime viewing platforms based on their age, whether or not they collect anime related merchandise, and their preference in anime. The results showed that an increase in age and collecting anime related merchandise increases one's log likelihood of using an official anime viewing platform to watch anime. Identifying which type of anime fans will use official platforms is important because it is one of the ways production companies make revenue.
